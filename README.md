# Nurul Faradila's Portfolio 🚀

Hi there! 👋 Thanks for checking out my portfolio. This is my little corner of the internet where I showcase my work as a Software Engineer, share my projects, and talk about what I'm learning.

I built this site to be fast, responsive, and easy to navigate. It's a reflection of my journey in tech—constantly evolving and improving.

## 🛠️ How It's Built

I love using modern tools that make development fun and the user experience smooth. Here's what's powering this site:

- **Next.js 16**: For that snappy performance and great SEO.
- **React 19**: The latest and greatest for building interactive UIs.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling without the hassle of writing custom CSS files.
- **TypeScript**: Because catching bugs early is always a good idea!

Thanks for visiting! 🌟
